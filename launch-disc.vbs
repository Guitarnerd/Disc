' Silently launches Disc (no console window). This is what the desktop
' shortcut points at.
'
' Checks whether Disc is already running first, by trying to activate a
' window titled "Disc — Music Library" (Electron sets this from
' BrowserWindow's `title` option even though the window is frameless and
' draws no visible native caption bar — Windows' own window manager still
' knows it by that title). The title is deliberately this specific and not
' just "Disc": AppActivate does a case-insensitive *prefix* match against
' every open window, so a plain "Disc" once matched a File Explorer window
' for a folder literally named "disc" and "activated" that instead of ever
' launching the app — the launcher silently did nothing, with no visible
' error since this whole script runs hidden.
' Without this check, clicking the shortcut while Disc is already open
' starts a second full Vite+Electron process tree that immediately
' collides with the first over port 5173 — Vite fails fast (server.
' strictPort in vite.config.js) and the whole thing exits within about a
' second, but silently, with no visible error (this whole script runs
' hidden) — which reads as "the shortcut doesn't do anything." Electron's
' own single-instance lock (see requestSingleInstanceLock in
' electron/main.js) can't catch this case on its own: the second Electron
' process usually never gets far enough to even run that check before
' concurrently's --kill-others tears it down.
